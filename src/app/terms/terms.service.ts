8. How We Use Cookies:

A “Cookie” is a small file that is usually temporarily stored on your electronic device, often by your internet browser; without limitation these Cookies also may be called pixels, bots, tags, code snippets, beacons, logs, log records, remarketing or retargeting protocols, or may include similar technologies (all of these foregoing are defined as “Cookies” or “cookies” here). The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used on our website(s) and webpage(s). This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to each user’s needs. We use this information for statistical analysis purposes.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your electronic device or any information about you other than the information you have elected to share with us by use of your browser and system settings.
Also, as part of our standard practices we do not monitor or recognize (and, therefore, our systems typically do not the capability to honor) any behavioral-advertising opt-out or do-not-track mechanisms, settings or signals, including those of your, or anyone else’s, web browser.
 You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser and other system settings to decline, modify or manage cookies, if you prefer. This may prevent or limit you from taking full advantage of our website and/or services.

9. Advertising and Third-party Contractors: Some of our ad networks, advertisers, social media platforms, email delivery and management service providers, payment processors or other independent third-party contractors (all “contractors” herein) occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by these contractors. We also may use advertising service contractors to help present advertisements on the website and on other sites across the internet. Our contractors also may use cookies to provide you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and/or to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements, or for other similar purposes. In doing so, these contractors may collect data such as your browser type, your operating system, email address(es), web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, IP/MAC address(es) and other clickstream data. Also, some of our contractors may be considered “data processors” under the GDPR, as applicable, which you acknowledge and agree shall have no bearing upon our being classified as such under the GDPR. The use of cookies by our contractors is subject to their own privacy policies and legal terms, not ours; therefore, you and we agree that we will have no liability in connection with the actions or inactions of these contractors or in connection with your actions or inactions with regard to your information that you may have provided to these contractors.

10. Links to Other Websites: Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we shall not be responsible for the content you may encounter or other results that may occur by your visiting these external sites, nor for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and that such sites are not governed by this policy, including in the event that any of such sites happens to be owned or operated by one of our contractors. You should exercise caution and look at the legal terms and the privacy policy or agreement applicable to the website in question.
